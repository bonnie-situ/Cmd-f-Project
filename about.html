    <h1>About De sci fi</h1>
    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>A dedicated group of first year UBC students hoping to contribute to a more accessible world. #forthegreatergood</p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <ul>Transcribe texts from poorly scanned or hard to read images or pdfs</ul>
    <ul>Deliver seamless results when DeciphAI is paired with a screenreader</ul>
    <ul>In the future, we hope to develop an app that can scan images instantaneously transcribe text.</ul>

    <h2> Currently...</h2>
    <p> Many image to text scanner uses Terreract, an optical character recognition engine.</p> 
    <p> However, there are still programs with the engine with text from poorly scanned images or handwritten notes not being transcribed correctly </p>
    <img src="Example.png" alt="A situation where image to text recognition works" height="500"/> 
    <p> Ex1: Image to text will work correctly </p>
    <img src="Example1.png" alt="A situation where image to text recognition does not work" height="500"/>
    <p> Ex2: Image to text will not work correctly</p>

    <h2>How will De sci fi work?</h2>
    <p> Help us train the program! We need samples of your hard to read or waterlogged writing samples! </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take an image of something unreadable.<br>
            Note: Make sure to save the writing sample as a pdf, jpg or png file. </li>
        <li>Upload your image to our form to contribute to our database!<br>
            Note: Include your email if you wish to see the results or learn more about the development of our project!</li>
    </ol>
    </p> Thank you for your support!</p>
