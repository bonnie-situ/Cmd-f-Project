Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress Before
and After Vitamin C Supplementation

Helaine M. Alessio, Allan H. Goldfarb, and Guohua Cao

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was supplemented (1 g/day) for 1 day and 2 weeks
in the same subjects. Plasma thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS)
and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) before and after 30 min
submaximal exercise were measured. Different vitamin C supplementations
did not affect resting TBARS or ORAC. Following 30 min exercise, values for
TBARS were 12.6 and 33% above rest with 1 day and 2 weeks of vitamin C
supplementation, respectively, compared to 46% higher with placebo. ORAC
did not significantly change (11%) after exercise with a placebo, nor when
subjects were given vitamin C supplements for 1 day or 2 weeks (4.9% and
5.73%, respectively). TBARS:ORAC, a ratio representing oxidative stress,
increased 32% (p < .05) with placebo compared to 5.8 and 25.8% with vitamin
C supplements for 1 day and 2 weeks, respectively. It was concluded that
exercise-induced oxidative stress was highest when subjects did not supple-
ment with vitamin C compared to either 1 day or 2 weeks of vitamin C
supplementation.

Dietary supplementation with vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has occurred at least
since the 18th century, when British sailors added vitamin C-rich foods to their diets
to prevent scurvy. In the late 20th century, vitamin C supplementation in vitamin C—
deficient people is believed to enhance health (7) and improve performance (8, 19).
The proposed mechanisms by which vitamin C prevents disease and enhances
health in vitamin C—deficient people vary, but one theory that has received recent
attention has focused on vitamin C’s contribution to antioxidant chain reactions.
Antioxidant activity of vitamin C continues to be investigated to determine how it
interacts with reactive oxygen species (ROS) (9). Vitamin C directly reduces
peroxyl radicals and indirectly reduces other free radicals by regenerating alpha
tocopherol (vitamin E) (Figure 1) after it is oxidized by either peroxyl or hydroxyl
radicals. The antioxidant benefits of vitamin C are of particular interest because of
the widespread use of vitamin C supplements and the ability of most humans to
tolerate high supplementation without toxic side effects (3). Tolerance of vitamin
