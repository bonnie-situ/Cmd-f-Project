Quiz 4 Bonus Mark Assignment

Student ID Number: {gE

Fill out this template with the appropriate information as you review your graded quiz. You must complete
each section for each question to gain the full mark back on your quiz. Make sure that you are explicit with
your improvement strategy. Just saying “I will study more” is not enough. How will you study more: is it
more time on specific content, more time in general (how do you/will you spend that time). Being more
specific now will help you in the long run. You do not need to have improvements for questions you got
correct.

You can print this out or use a tablet if you want to add drawings. You may also create your own version
